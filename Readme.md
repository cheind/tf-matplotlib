### **tf-matplotlib** - seamless integration of matplotlib figures into TensorFlow summaries

**tf-matplotlib** allows your everyday matplotlib figures to be rendered inside TensorFlow's Tensorboard visualization interface. **tf-matplotlib** 
 - takes care of evaluating input tensors prior to plotting, 
 - avoids matplotlib threading issues
 - support multiple figures and,
 - provides blitting for runtime critical plotting. 
 
The following TensorFlow summary is generated by [sgd.py](tfmpl/samples/sgd.py). It plots the progress of gradient descent optimizers on a test surface. To avoid redrawing the test surface, it makes use of blitting. See [usage](#usage) below for a more introductory example.

### Usage
<a name="usage"></a>

Below are the relevant snippets to render a simple scatter plot. See [scatter.py](tfmpl/samples/scatter.py) for the complete self-contained example.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

import tfmpl

@tfmpl.figure_tensor
def draw_scatter(scaled, colors): 
    '''Draw scatter plots. One for each color.'''  
    figs = tfmpl.create_figures(len(colors), figsize=(4,4))
    for idx, f in enumerate(figs):
        ax = f.add_subplot(111)
        ax.axis('off')
        ax.scatter(scaled[:, 0], scaled[:, 1], c=colors[idx])
        f.tight_layout()

    return figs

with tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:

    # A point cloud that can be scaled by the user
    points = tf.constant(
        np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=(100, 2)).astype(np.float32)
    )
    scale = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)        
    scaled = points*scale

    # Note, `scaled` above is a tensor. Its being passed `draw_scatter` below. 
    # However, when `draw_scatter` is invoked, the tensor will be evaluated and a
    # numpy array representing its content is provided.   
    image_tensor = draw_scatter(scaled, ['r', 'g'])
    image_summary = tf.summary.image('scatter', image_tensor)      
    all_summaries = tf.summary.merge_all() 
    
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('log', sess.graph)
    summary = sess.run(all_summaries, feed_dict={scale: 2.})
    writer.add_summary(summary, global_step=0)
```

### Draw utilities

When doing classification, a common task is to generate a confusion matrix. **tf-matplotlib** provides `tfmpl.draw.confusion_matrix` to quickly generate such a plot from labels and predictions. The following plot shows classification training progress on the MNIST classification task. Full sample code is provided in [mnist.py](tfmpl/samples/mnist.py).
